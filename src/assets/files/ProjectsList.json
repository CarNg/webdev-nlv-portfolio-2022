		"projectDetails": {
			"Summary": "Anything But Small Talk! (ABST!) is the first game I designed solo and it's a personal favourite. It is inspired by YouTube channel SourceFedNERD’s Table Talk series, Apollo Robbins' TED Talk on 'The Art of Misdirection' and introversion. I had come across the quote 'Introverts do not hate small talk because we dislike people. We hate small talk because we hate the barrier it creates between people.' That was something that I related to so strongly that I wanted to design a game that would break that barrier, give players the opportunity to share their stories and encourage us to listen to each other.",
			"Gameplay": "So how does this storytelling card game work? Each card will have two parts - 'Talk' and 'Listen'. 'Talk' is the conversation topic while 'Listen' is a question relating to the topic. Let's use a simple example: 'Talk' may be ‘Discuss your favourite movie and why.’ and 'Listen' may be ‘Who is the director of my favourite movie?’. The first player, we'll call him James, will draw a card and share what's on the 'Talk' side with the rest of the group. The 'Listen' side is for James to know. For the next *five minutes, the group will discuss their favourite movies. During this time, James must clearly mention who the director of his favourite movie is (as mentioned on the 'Listen' side) at least twice. James' objective is to do so subtly. His goal is the misdirect the other players from the real question. He can do this by steering the conversation away from the director or appear to focus on other aspects of the movie more. Meanwhile, the other players are trying to figure out what the question is and remember the answer. All the while, trying to distract the other players from doing the same. Once every player has had a go, in the same order the cards were drawn, the question on the 'Listen' side of the cards will now be asked by the player who drew the card. In this example, James will now ask ‘Who is the director of my favourite movie?’. For each wrong answer, James will get a point. For every answer a player gets right, they get two points. This will continue till all players have asked their question. Play restarts and continues and the first player to reach *10 points wins.",
			"Customise": "*You can tweak the rules to suit your group! ABST! is flexible and there are many variants that can be tailored to suit the environment you’re playing in. The above is simply a guideline. You can change how long each discussion is or how many points are required to win. You can even switch it up by changing the winning conditions altogether. It could be most points after X amount of rounds or maybe it's game night or a dinner party and you want conversation to flow all night; you can eliminate time limits altogether. For example, at the start of the night, each participant draws two cards each and conversations on those topics carry on throughout the night. At the end of the night, the questions are asked and the best listener wins! Of course, the topics are entirely customisable too! You can always make your own topics, hypothetical or factual. The stories you share can be real or they can be made up. The answers can be as serious or as silly and light-hearted as you want. That’s all up to you. Make it suit your game group, have fun with it! Just talk about ABST!",
			"Experience": "Like I said, ABST! is the first game I designed solo and it's one that has a soft spot in my heart. The game itself is still only an idea and one with no real playtesting. However, it is still a personal favourite because as the design grew, so did my passion for game design. The prospect of making and sharing this game was thrilling. Not only was I designing a game that I wanted to play, I was designing it based on something I cared about deeply and couldn't wait to share."

Get caught three times and you'll end up getting detention instead of a date. The teacher will become more aware as time goes on so watch out.",
			"Responsibilities": " Sketch! was a solo project that was developed using Unity and art designed using Photoshop. All aspects of the game (game design, programming, art work) except audio and fonts are my own. I take no credit for the audio and no copyright infringements are intended.",
			"Experience": "Developing Sketch! was a great learning experience. A number of mechanics were added and refined during the design and development process as a result of testing. For example, playtesting proved that the initial game was too easy and predictable. So to overcome this, different triggers were added to the speed and direction of the teacher to add unpredictability. Sketch! also showed me how a simple and seemingly boring theme like 'School' can actually generate so many interesting mechanics and be developed into a fun little game."

			"Summary": "Alden Nowlan's quote 'The day the child realizes that all adults are imperfect, he becomes an adolescent; the day he forgives them, he becomes an adult; the day he forgives himself, he becomes wise.' makes up the backbone of the narrative for This Time Around. The inspiration for the story is actually a personal one. As someone who has trouble remembering their childhood, the idea of discovering it all again (essentially, for the first time) was fascinating to me and I wanted to pursue the idea that by revisiting your past you can learn and see things in a new perspective that you may have never considered before. As a player, you adopt the characters you play. Often times, players don't know the characters' history or background and you discover these things on your own, in your own time. Much like if I were to delve into my own childhood, most of which I don't remember; and that's how This Time Around came to be.",
			"Gameplay": "Players (re)discover memories as Rachel Daniels in This Time Around, learning things she may have forgotten or have never revisited before through letters and objects throughout the game world. We often forget to look at things from someone else's perspective, and we forget that everyone that comes and goes in our lives leaves behind a part of them within us. Good or bad, we learn from them, and This Time Around aims to be that reminder.",
			"Responsibilities": "This Time Around was a yearlong solo project. This included being the game designer, writer and programmer. The UI was also designed and created by myself. The models and audio used in the game however were sourced from Archive3d and Freesound. The project also included writing a thesis and recording the full process of the game development from an idea to final product, marketing the game on social media and gathering playtesters and working with them.",
			"Experience": "The project was invaluable in terms of the things it taught me. Not only did I learn endless ways of problem solving in game development and how to code practically through hours of researching and experimenting. I also learned how to develop a game from an idea into a completed game through playtesting and a number of iterations. The project was iterated using a design-build-test cycle and that was the biggest learning experience of all. The cycle allowed me to understand user needs and the importance of playtesting and refining accordingly. In order to create a game for the target audience, this playtest and refinement cycle is vital. There is no doubt that the things I learned from this project can and will be carried forward to all future projects."

The aim of the game is to establish an unbroken connection that starts from the base of the board and runs 6 blocks high to the designated end point. A dropped block must connect to your existing Circuit, if you run out of options or get successfully blocked, you're out of the game.",
			"Responsibilities": "Circuits was a group project where I worked with Aisling Flynn, Gemma Gallagher and Sona Harrison. No single role was assigned to anyone on the project as everything from design and production to completion was done collectively as a team.",
			"Experience": "Overall, I think that we developed the beginnings of an interesting and challenging game. There is no doubt that Circuits would need much more playtesting and refining in order to reach its full potential but I believe that it could have been developed into a strong game with time. The project was also a great demonstration of the power of working on a strong team that communicated and worked well together. Weekly meetings allowed us to present our individual ideas and research and discuss our next steps together. This allowed for a great, encouraging and supportive environment and a smooth process in creating Circuits."

We found that the main flaw of the game is its repetition and lack of player interaction. So our goal was to add variety and unpredictability to the game as well as player interaction. We achieved this by adding ways to affect other players and making the 'track' random.",
			"Gameplay": "The 'track' of Hopscotch 2 is made up of separate piece (this can be pieces of foam or paper). Each piece will have its own colour and is associated with a single element. The track is constructed in a randomised pattern and each player is assigned an element. The starting element on the track will determine which players' turn it is. This player must hop to the end of the track using only the pieces associated with their element. When they are on their second piece, they must pick up the starting piece on the track (they can stand on two feet but must not fall off) and carry it with them till the end of the track. Once they are there, they must place it down at the end. Therefore, creating a new pattern. Each player also gets a single use 'stone' that can be used to help them on more difficult patterns. Players may toss the stone on the track which will allow them to then hop on the piece that the stone lands on regardless of element type. If a player falls or steps on the wrong element, they are eliminated along with all their element pieces on the track. The aim is to be the last one standing.",
			"Responsibilities": "Hopscotch 2 was a group project between me, Aisling Flynn, Philippa Kelly and Diana Volovei. The game was researched, designed and playtested collectively.",
			"Experience": "We found that the new elements (pun intended) made the game more fun and significantly more engaging. It created more interaction between players as other players' turn would affect the 'track' each time. This also added strategy into the game. The changing of the tracks also made the game more challenging as each player elimination would increase the difficulty of the track. Player elimination was originally a concern of ours but it didn't become a problem since games were often short (and it's fun watching people struggling not to fall too). The project was an interesting and informative exercise in game design. Being able to examine a game, find the weaknesses and come up with solutions is a vital skill and this project was a great example of that."

The game was developed in GameSalad and my role involved implementing the controls and mechanics of the game as well as applying the art and audio work received from other team members into the game. My role as producer included setting the tasks each week in order to keep the project on schedule. It was vital that we met our marks each week in order to keep up with the tight schedule.",
			"Experience": "Pigeon Invasion was my first group development project and it was a major learning experience in that sense. It showed the importance of establishing roles, communication and team work. It was clear that those aspects were able to make or break a project and a team. Understanding the importance of communication and team work allowed for much smoother group projects in the future. Pigeon Invasion was also my first experience with game testing and refining. The mechanics of the game, although based on Choplifter, took many iterations due to the translation from console controls to touchscreen controls. What the team initially taught would be relatively simple turned into a much larger and tedious task and many iterations were made during development as a result. It's a great example on the importance of controls design and beign able to adapt when expectations are not met."
